>>>>>>> Stashed changes

### Project requirements:
- Develop a classifier for the adult census dataset using advanced machine learning techniques

### Dataset:
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

### Getting started:
- Install poetry:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
```
=======
```sh
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
- Configure poetry to install virtual environment inside project folders:
```sh
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
- Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:olivier-2018/Adv_ML_techniques_for_imbalanced_dataset.git
# then
cd Adv_ML_techniques_for_imbalanced_dataset
```
- Create a poetry virtual environment within the repository:
```sh
poetry install
```
- Activate the virtual environment:
```sh
poetry shell
```
- Run the jupyter notebook using your favorite IDE:
